# Time-Series-Forecasting

What can be forecast?
Forecasting is required in many situations: Deciding whether to build another power generation plant in the next five years requires forecast of future demand; scheduling staff in a call centre next week requires forecast of call volumns; stocking an inventory requires forecasts of stock requirements. Forecast can be required several years in advance (for the case of capital investments), or only a few minutes beforehand (for telecommunication routing). Whatever the circumstances or time horizons involved, forecasting is an important aid to effective and efficient planning.

Some things are easier to forecast than others. The time of the sunrise tomorrow morning can be forecast precisely. On the other hand, tomorrow's lotto numbers cannot be forecast with any accuracy. The predictability of an event or a quantity depends on several factors, including:
1. How well we understand the factors that contribute to it
2. How much data is available
3. How similar the future to the past
4. Whether the forecast can affect the thing we are trying to forecast

5. For example, short-term forecast of residential electricity demand can be highly accurate because all four conditions are usually satisfied.
